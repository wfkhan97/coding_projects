# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Product Name
CitiBike Dock Availability Predictor  

---

## Objective
Develop a simple, data-driven tool that predicts dock availability at the five closest stations to a specified destination. Initially, the app will be a Python-based local script where users input variables, and predictions are provided based on historical data and time of day.  

---

## User Pain Points  
1. **Dock Availability Uncertainty**  
   Riders frequently encounter full docking stations upon arrival, leading to delays and frustration.  

2. **Lack of Planning Tools**  
   No existing system allows riders to predict dock availability near their destination effectively.  

3. **Limited Alternative Suggestions**  
   Riders struggle to identify nearby stations when their primary choice is full.

## MVP Scope  

### Core Functionality  
1. **User Input (Local Python Script)**  
   - Input variables:  
     - **Destination**: Address or ZIP code of the desired docking station.  
     - **Estimated Time of Arrival**: User-specified time of arrival at the destination.  

2. **Prediction Model**  
   - The MVP will leverage historical dock availability data and time-of-day patterns.  
   - The system will predict:  
     - Dock availability at the **5 closest stations** to the destination.  

3. **Output**  
   - Ranked list of 5 stations including:  
     - Predicted likelihood of an open dock.  
     - Distance from the specified destination.  
     - Estimated wait times (if immediate availability is unlikely).

## Technical Approach  

1. **Data Sources**  
   - Historical CitiBike trip data (e.g., dock usage patterns, time of day trends).  

2. **Modeling Approach**  
   - A basic statistical model or a rule-based system using historical trends.  

3. **Local Execution**  
   - The interface will be a Python script run locally.  

4. **Outputs**  
   - Results displayed as a simple ranked list in the console or exported to a text/CSV file.

## Future Enhancements (Beyond MVP)  
1. **Enhanced Model Accuracy**  
   - Incorporate real-time data and additional features like weather or events.  

2. **Web or Mobile Interface**  
   - Transition from a local Python script to a more user-friendly web or mobile app.  

3. **Expanded Scope**  
   - Predict bike availability in addition to dock availability.  
   - Provide alternative routes to nearby stations.
